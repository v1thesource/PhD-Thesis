\section{\zirconia\ phases and stabilisation}

\zirconia\ is unusual in exhibiting three commonly reported polytypes in its binary phase diagram (Figure \ref{figure:binary_phase_diagram}). Each will now be described and contrasted.

\subsection{Monoclinic}

A unit cell of monoclinic \zirconia\ is illustrated in Figure \ref{figure:coordination}. The dashed line (approximately 3.7\r{A} in length) shows the Zr-O bond which is broken when transitioning to monoclinic from the tetragonal phase.

\subsection{Tetragonal}

\subsection{Cubic}

\subsubsection{Cubic phase stability}

\begin{itemize}
\item The existence of a cubic phase in undoped \zirconia\ is debated. The high temperatures required for stabilisation of the cubic phase and the similarity to the tetragonal phase make it difficult to discern as a third phase.
\item Also due to the high temperature, the stability of the cubic phase in DFT calculations may be inaccurate. This is discussed further in Chapter 3.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Other phases}

\subsubsection{Cotunnite}

Two orthorhombic phases of \zirconia\ have also been observed at high pressures.

  \label{fig:cotunnite_structure}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Volume expansion}

The phase transitions in \zirconia\ are accompanied by a change in volume, where the monoclinic phase is the least dense and the cubic phase is the most dense (see Figure \ref{figure:zrobonddistance}). This is especially significant in the case of the martensitic t-\zirconia\ to m-\zirconia\ transition, where the volume increases by around 9\% \cite{Gupta1977}. This has substantial implications for the creation and opening of cracks as \zirconia\ is a ceramic material with low toughness. This is especially relevant in a reactor scenario where temperature cycling (shutdown/startup or load-following behaviour) may lead to fatigue if the phase transition threshold is passed.

Another consequence of this large volume expansion is that a significant hysteresis effect is observed in the monoclinic/tetragonal phase transition, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:phasediagram}. 
%as the resulting coherency strain is likely to result in reduced mobility of fission products that have been embedded in the bulk crystal.

\subsection{Pressure stabilisation (isochoric + autostabilisation)}

The tetragonal and cubic phases of \zirconia\ are stabilised at high pressure. Since the oxide has a larger volume than the underlying metal (pilling-bedworth ratio of 1.5X), the growth of the oxide will itself impose stresses which may stabilise the tetragonal phase.

\subsection{Dopant stabilisation (lower valence cations)}

Particular kinds of dopants will also stabilise the tetragonal and cubic phases of \zirconia. The most technologically significant of which is yttrium, which at concentrations of 15\% (atomic), fully stabilises the cubic phase. Zirconia stabilised this way is known as yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ). This works by trivalent yttrium promoting the inclusion of charge compensating oxygen vacancy defects (see Equation \ref{equation:YSZ}). This works in a similar way with several other cation dopants such as trivalent scandium from Sc$_{2}$O$_{3}$, or divalent magnesium from MgO (Equation \ref{equation:mg_stabilised_zro2}).

\begin{equation}
Y_{2}O_{3} = 2\ch{Y_{Zr}^{'}} + \ch{V_{O}^{**}} + 3\ch{O_{O}^{x}} 
\label{equation:YSZ}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
MgO= \ch{Mg_{Zr}^{''}} + \ch{V_{O}^{**}} + \ch{O_{O}^{x}} 
\label{equation:mg_stabilised_zro2}
\end{equation}

While \zirconia\ would ideally adopt the regular cubic fluorite structure, we only observe cubic stabilisation at elevated temperatures where the ionic radii of the zirconium ion increases (and possibly a stabilising phonon mode contribution). Yttrium is known to stabilise the cubic phase in \zirconia\ at standard conditions. This stabilising effect is observed because the yttrium ion is of the appropriate size to maintain the oxygen ions and vacancies in the VIII coordination at low temperatures, as can be seen from ionic radii values in Table \ref{figure:ionicradii}. 

%This is accomplished by substituting a Zr\textsuperscript{4+} ion with Y\textsuperscript{3+} and the binding of two neighbouring oxygen vacancies, effectively producing a sub-unit of yttria (Y\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{3}) in the \zirconia\ lattice.

%\section{Point Defects}

\subsection{Kr\"{o}ger-Vink notation}

Kr\"{o}ger-Vink notation \cite{kroger1956relations} is used throughout this thesis to describe defects. It is widely used in physical chemistry and is a useful shorthand for describing chemical reactions where conservation of mass, charge and lattice sites is required. The notation syntax is of the form \ch{x^{y}_{z}}, where x is the substituted atom or missing atom (i.e. a vacancy V), y is the charge of the defect (relative to the lattice species that originally occupied the site) and z is the site the defect occupies. Positive and negative charges are indicated with dots (\ch{^{*}}) and dashes (\ch{^{'}}) respectively, otherwise a cross (\ch{^{x}}) is used to denote a neutral defect. The site may be either a lattice site (such as Zr or O in \zirconia ) or an interstitial site ($i$). Table \ref{table:krogervink} shows examples of several different types of defects and their respective Kr\"{o}ger-Vink notation.
