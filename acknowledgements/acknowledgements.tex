\begin{acknowledgements}

Firstly I would like to thank my supervisors Robin Grimes and Mark Wenman for giving me a chance (despite being a lowly mechanical engineer) and opening the door to pursue nuclear engineering at such a high level. I would also like to thank the EPSRC for funding my studentship through the ICO CDT, the Imperial College HPC team for their quick responses whenever something went wrong, Philipp Frankel and his research group at the University of Manchester for the fruitful discussions and insightful conferences over the years, the Department of Materials administration staff for all their help with my admin woes and the Centre for Nuclear Engineering for being my second home for half a decade.

In no particular order, I want to give a shoutout to the great people who have left a strong impression on me and influenced my growth both as a scientist and as a person: Wael Al Jishi, Conor Galvin, Paul Fossati, Claudia Gasparrini, Navaratnarajah Kuganathan, Mamdouh Farid, Dhan-Sham Rana, Said El Chamaa, Filippo Vecchiato, Jana Smutna, Vlad Podgurschi, Matt Jackson, Lloyd Jones, Nipun Wickramasundara, Hussam Zaghal, Patrick Burr, Mohammed El Shibib, William White, Mark Mawdsley, Richard Pearson, Sophie Morrison, Alan Charles, Jonathan Tate, Andy Wilson, John Brokx, Alexandru Paunoiu, Irina Dumitrescu, Julian Sutherland, Anca Semenescu and Emma Warriss.

Finally, I give my everlasting gratitude and love to my parents, my wife Cristina and my daughter Livia-May.
