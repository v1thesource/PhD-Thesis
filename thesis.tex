\chapter{ParaSweep}

ParaSweep is a generalised sensitivity analysis visualisation tool which was developed during this project. Initially, it was built to help visualise the effects of changing single parameters in Brouwer diagrams, such as temperature or concentration of defects. 


\chapter{CASTEP and HPC Scripts}

Throughout the course of this work, many useful scripts were created to help with preparing CASTEP jobs and analysing their outputs. These scripts have been made available online and for free at \href{https://github.com/v1thesource/CASTEP}{https://github.com/v1thesource/CASTEP}. The purpose of open-sourcing these scripts is to simplify the experience for new users of CASTEP and help them save a considerable amount of time.
