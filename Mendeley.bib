abstract = {The total energy and equation of state of the monoclinic, tetragonal, cubic, orthorhombic-I (Pbca) and orthorhombic-II (cotunnite) phases of zirconia and hafnia are determined using density functional theory (DFT) in the local density (LDA) and generalized-gradient (GGA) approximations. It is found that GGA corrections are needed to obtain low-temperature phase transitions under pressure that are consistent with experiment, i.e., (monoclinic→ orthorhombic-I→cotunnite). The GGA values of the bulk modulus of the cotunnite phase are found to be 251 and 259GPa for ZrO2 and HfO2 respectively, highlighting the similarity of these two compounds. We introduce a population analysis scheme in which atomic radii are adapted to the actual charge distribution in the material. The results indicate that the effective atomic radius of Hf is smaller than that of Zr, a drastic manifestation of the relativistic lanthanide contraction. The population analysis demonstrates that ionicity: (i) decreases from the monoclinic to the cotunnite phase, and (ii) is larger for HfO2 than for ZrO2. The bandgap and heat of formation are also larger for monoclinic HfO2 than for ZrO2 by 0.60eV and 0.60eV/formula unit, respectively. The tetragonal phase, which often exists as a metastable phase at ambient conditions, has a bandgap larger than the monoclinic phase by 0.35 and 0.65eV for ZrO2 and HfO2, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

Round subgrains were also observed on the surface of fabrication pores along the pellet radius. These round-shaped subgrains seem to be associated to free surface rearrangement. This new type of round subgrains was proved to be independent of the rim effect. Observations of the fuel structure in the vicinity of rim area evidenced two types of defects specific to rim effect: planar defects and small intergranular pores. Hypothesis is made that the accumulation of planar defects could generate polyhedral subgrains, a new description of the rim effect is proposed including this planar defect. These observations prove that a careful examination of subgrains morphology is necessary to identify rim effect. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The clean surface and several oxidized surfaces were investigated, with oxygen coverages up to 1.5 ML (1 ML = 1 O-atom per surface metal atom). In order to compare the energies of the oxidized structures, which comprise different numbers of metal and oxygen atoms, one has to take account of the chemical potentials of the Ni, Al and O. To this end, for each system, we have applied simple analytic models to study their surface energy as a function of temperature, alloy stoichiometry (assumed to be near 50-50) and oxygen partial pressure. The calculations predict how, at oxygen pressures just above the threshold for decomposing NiAl, the clean surface should be coated by an alumina layer, with the consequent depletion of Ni near the surface. Varying stoichiometry has the relatively minor effect of shifting the crossovers in oxygen pressure at which different oxidized surfaces become stable. {\textcopyright}2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {We investigate by atomic force microscopy (AFM) the surface relief resulting from martensitic tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation induced by low temperature autoclave aging in ceria-stabilized zirconia. AFM appears as a very powerful tool to investigate martensite relief quantitatively and with a great precision. The crystallographic phenomenological theory is used to predict the expected relief induced by the transformation, for the particular case of lattice correspondence ABC1, where tetragonal c axis becomes the monoclinic c axis. A model for variants spatial arrangement for this lattice correspondence is proposed and validated by the experimental observations. An excellent agreement is found between the quantitative calculations outputs and the experimental measurements at nanometer scale yielded by AFM. All the observed features are explained fully quantitatively by the calculations, with discrepancies between calculations and quantitative experimental measurements within the measurements and calculations precision range. In particular, the crystallographic orientation of the transformed grains is determined from the local characteristics of transformation induced relief. It is finally demonstrated that the strain energy is the controlling factor of the surface transformation induced by low temperature autoclave treatments in this material. {\textcopyright} 2004 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract = {We have performed a first-principles study of the structural and vibrational properties of the three low-pressure (cubic, tetragonal, and especially monoclinic) phases of ZrO2, with special attention to the computation of the zone-center phonon modes and related dielectric properties. The calculations have been carried out within the local-density approximation using ultrasoft pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis. The fully relaxed structural parameters are found to be in excellent agreement with experimental data and with previous theoretical work. The total-energy calculations correctly reproduce the energetics of the ZrO2 phases, and the calculated zone-center phonon frequencies yield good agreement with the infrared and Raman experimental frequencies in the monoclinic phase. The Born effective charge tensors are computed and, together with the mode eigenvectors, used to decompose the lattice dielectric susceptibility tensor into contributions arising from individual infrared-active phonon modes. This work has been partially motivated by the potential for ZrO2 to replace SiO2 as the gate-dielectric material in modern integrated-circuit technology.},

abstract = {The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has conducted a series of coordinated research projects (CRPs) that have focused on irradiated reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steel fracture toughness properties and approaches for assuring structural Integrity of RPVs throughout operating life. A series of nine CRPs has been sponsored by the IAEA, starting in the early 1970s, focused on neutron radiation effects on RPV steels. The purpose of the CRPs was to develop comparisons and correlations to test the uniformity of Irradiated results through coordinated international research studies and data sharing. Consideration of dose rate effects, effects of alloying nickel, manganese, silicon, etc.) and residual elements (e.g., copper and phosphorus), and drop in upper shelf toughness Is also Important for assessing neutron embrittlement effects. The ultimate use of embrittlement understanding Is assuring structural Integrity of the RPV under current and future operation and accident conditions. Material fracture toughness is the key Ingredient needed for this assessment, and many of the CRPs have focused on measurement and application of Irradiated fracture toughness. This paper presents an overview of the progress made since the Inception of the CRPs In the early 1970s.

abstract = {Atkins' Physical Chemistry epitomises the benchmark of achievement for a chemistry degree throughout the world. Its broad coverage, concise explanations, and robust mathematical support are clearly presented in an engaging style to furnish students with a solid foundation in the subject. In this ninth edition the authors continue to refine their presentation of physical chemistry. The coverage of introductory topics is streamlined, and the addition of a new fundamentals chapter provides students with an overview of key principles on which the subject is based. The text includes increased coverage of computational chemistry and additional contextual examples of materials chemistry throughout, mirroring the current needs of today's students and lecturers. Mathematics remains an intrinsic yet challenging part of physical chemistry. Extensive mathematical support, including a 'Checklist of key equations' at the end of every chapter, and 'Mathematical background' sections containing worked examples and self-tests, empower students to overcome any barriers to understanding that grasping the mathematical content might present. These features help to ensure the reader can master the subject without a need to sacrifice the rigour and depth of the mathematical content. The pedagogical framework, which is a hallmark of the authors' writing, has been further strengthened. New 'Key points' provide summaries of the main take-home messages of each section and enable students to gain an overview of the topic before tackling it in depth; 'Brief illustrations' give a concise insight into how a particular mathematical concept is applied in practice, providing students with the opportunity to contextualise their learning. All these exciting new features and innovations are presented within a refreshed full colour text design, to stimulate and engage students yet further. The Online Resource Centre contains Living Graphs, illustrations from the book, and web links. An Instructor's Solutions Manual (free to adopters) and a Student's Solutions Manual are also available. Access to the Physical Chemistry eBook is also included with the purchase of the printed text. Offering enhanced functionality, including notetaking and highlighting, it also includes access to 'Explorations in Physical Chemistry', which contains interactive Excel worksheets and exercises related to the Living Graphs, allowing students to visualise, actively explore and test their understanding of the subject.},

@article{Oskarsson2001,
abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of predicting post-transition oxidation behaviour by studying the properties of pre-transition oxides. Five different zirconium alloys have been tested in autoclave at two different temperatures, 288??C and 360??C. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that a significant difference in morphology is obtained for the two test temperatures, while the alloy composition was found to have no influence. At the lower test temperature the oxide consists of a mixture of columnar and equiaxed grains, while at the higher temperature mainly columnar grains are observed and the size of these grains is a factor 3-4 longer. Tetragonal oxide phase was mainly detected by selected area diffraction in the thicker oxide layers, while the amount of the tetragonal phase in the thermally formed oxides is too low to be detected by X-ray diffraction. Thus, the tetragonal phase is probably stabilised by other factors than the compressive stress. The impedance measurement shows that the thinnest oxide layers are compact, irrespective of the alloy composition and thermal or anodic oxide growth. For the thicker oxides, a porous outer layer is developed. There is a main difference in the morphology between thermal and anodic oxide layers of the same size, i.e., the anodically formed oxide layer has only equiaxed grains present. Based on the result obtained in this investigation, no prediction of the post-transition oxidation can be made. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

For 135In, 135Eu, 135Gd and 135Tb, only the half-lives and isotopic identifications are established without any knowledge of their level structures and $\beta$ decay schemes. Extensive high-spin structures are known for 135Te, 135I, 135Ba, 135La, 135Ce, 135Pr, 135Nd, 135Pm and 135Sm; including a superdeformed structure in 135Nd. Only limited high-spin data are available for 135Sb and the data for 135La are from a thesis only. Neutron capture $\gamma$-ray data are available in detail for 135Ba (thermal and resonance energies) and marginally for 135Cs (thermal neutrons). Single particle-transfer data exist for 135Xe and 135Ba; and marginally for 135I and 135La. In the opinion of the evaluators, the decay schemes from $\beta$ decays of 135Sn, 135Xe, 135Pr, 135Pm isomers and 135Sm are not well established.

abstract = {The convergence of the electrostatic energy in calculations using periodic boundary conditions is considered in the context of periodic solids and localized aperiodic systems in the gas and condensed phases. Conditions for the absolute convergence of the total energy in periodic boundary conditions are obtained, and their implications for calculations of the properties of polarized solids under the zero-field assumption are discussed. For aperiodic systems the exact electrostatic energy functional in periodic boundary conditions is obtained. The convergence in such systems is considered in the limit of large supercells, where, in the gas phase, the computational effort is proportional to the volume. It is shown that for neutral localized aperiodic systems in either the gas or condensed phases, the energy can always be made to converge as O(L-5) where L is the linear dimension of the supercell. For charged systems, convergence at this rate can be achieved after adding correction terms to the energy to account for spurious interactions induced by the periodic boundary conditions. These terms are derived exactly for the gas phase and heuristically for the condensed phase.},

abstract = {We review here the theory of the early stages of oxidation of the (110) surface of Ni1-xAlx, based on ab initio calculations using a plane-wave pseudopotential method. The clean surface and several oxidized surfaces have been investigated, with oxygen coverages up to 2 ML of oxygen (I ML = 3 0 atoms per 2 surface Al atoms). The theory to date is a description in terms of equilibrium thermodynamics, with a comparison of the free energies of several surfaces of different composition, implemented at the atomic scale. Three environmental parameters are singled out as control variables in this treatment, namely the alloy composition x (assumed to be near 0.5), the temperature T and the partial pressure of oxygen p(O2), With certain reasonable approximations an analytic formula for the surface energy sigma is derived in terms of these variables and some constants that are calculated ab initio together with others that are derived from experimental thermodynamic tables. At oxygen pressures just above the threshold for bulk oxidation of NiAl, the calculations explain the observed formation of a thin film of alumina in place of NiAl surface layers, with the consequent dissolution of Ni into the bulk. Ab initio calculations illustrate how the energetics of supplying Al to the surface depends on bulk stoichiometry, which alters the relative stability of different surface oxidation states so as to favour oxidation more if the alloy is Al-rich than if it is Ni-rich.},

abstract = {The addition of suitable dopants to ZrO2 can induce dramatic phase stabilization, and this dopant-induced phase stabilization is the basis of transformation toughening of zirconia-based structural ceramics. We have determined the electronic structure of three phases of ZrO2, cubic, tetragonal, and monoclinic, using vacuum-ultraviolet and x-ray-photoemission spectroscopies, coupled with ab initio band-structure and optical property calculations using the orthogonalized linear-combination-of-atomic-orbitals method, in an attempt to understand the complex interaction of the stabilizing dopants and associated atomic defects with the crystal structures of ZrO2 and their phase transitions. The experimental samples were single or polycrystalline stabilized materials which contain atomic defects, while the calculations were performed for undoped idealized ZrO2 structures without atomic defects. Reasonable agreement is found between experiment and theory at this level. The primary difference among the three phases of ZrO2 is the hybridization or mixing of the Zr 4d (x2-y2 and z2) and the Zr 4d (xy, yz, and zx) bands, which form the conduction bands as the symmetry decreases from cubic to monoclinic. This leads to a complex evolution of the O 2p to Zr 4d and the O 2s to Zr 4d interband transitions. In addition, in the real materials, the presence of yttrium stabilizer introduces additional Y 4p valence bands and Y 4d conduction bands. The effective coordination of zirconium by oxygen is reduced from eight-fold to sevenfold by the presence of the stabilizing ions and defects and this leads to the introduction of an occupied Zr 4d valence band suggestive of the presence of Zr2+.},

abstract = {The important developments in nuclear fuels and their problems are reviewed and compared with the status of present light-water reactor fuels. The limitations of LWR fuels are reviewed with respect to important recent concerns, namely provision of outlet coolant temperatures high enough for use in H2 production, destruction of plutonium to eliminate proliferation concerns, and burning of the minor actinides to reduce the waste repository heat load and long-term radiation hazard. In addition to current oxide-based fuel rod designs, the hydride fuel with liquid–metal thermal bonding of the fuel-cladding gap is covered. Finally, two of the most promising Generation IV reactor concepts, the very high temperature reactor and the sodium fast reactor, and the accompanying reprocessing technologies, aqueous-based UREX+1a and pyrometallurgical, are summarized. In all of the topics covered, the thermodynamics involved in the fuel's behavior under irradiation and in the reprocessing schemes are emphasized.},

abstract = {In this Brief Report, we use density functional theory to predict the existence of a heretofore unobserved crystalline compound, BaCl, and additionally predict it to be isostructural with NaCl (rocksalt). Due to the chemistry of Ba, which strongly prefers a 2+ charge state, compounds where Ba nominally exhibits a +1 charge (e.g., BaCl) are unlikely to be synthesized via conventional solid-state approaches. However, in considering the chemical evolution of 137Cs to 137Ba via $\beta$− radioactive decay in a model nuclear waste form CsCl, we find that BaCl may be indeed relevant. The mechanical stability of this surprising structure is confirmed through examination of its elastic constants and phonon-dispersion relations. We have also analyzed the chemical bonding of rocksalt BaCl and found it to exhibit a complex mixture of ionic, metallic, and covalent characters. From our results, we demonstrate that the chemical evolution of crystalline structures due to radioactive decay may be a viable synthesis route for unforeseen materials with interesting properties.},

abstract = {A thermodynamic model is developed to understand the origin of variation in the microstructure of ZrO2 film formed on zirconium alloys and its effects on corrosion resistance. The correlation among the tetragonal phase fraction, the stress (macroscopic and internal one), the ZrO2 grain size and the microstructural change of oxide film is formulized, and then analyzed. The results show that many complicated factors simultaneously govern the microstructure of oxide film. The tetragonal phase content near the oxide/metal interface, the macroscopic compressive stress near the interface, the decline gradient of macroscopic compressive stress and the internal stress induced by the transformation from the tetragonal to the monoclinic phase have very important influences on the transition from columnar grains to equiaxed grains, the crack formation and the degradation of oxidation resistance. The presence of intermetallic precipitates in oxide film may effectively relax the internal stress caused by transformation strain, stabilize the columnar-grain structure and reduce the probability of crack formation. How to reduce the transformation stress in the oxide film is a key to improve the corrosion resistance of zirconium alloys. ?? 2006 Acta Materialia Inc.},

Oxygen vacancies in the cubic phase are also studied using a supercell approach. The structural parameters, including all internal degrees of freedom of all phases, are relaxed. Excellent agreement is achieved with experiment and with other ab initio calculations available. We compute the quasiparticle band gaps within Hedin's GW approximation using the method of Hybertsen and Louie, and confirm that the quasiparticle approach can be successfully applied to transition-metal oxides if the core-valence overlap is small. We predict the fundamental gap of pure cubic, tetragonal, and monoclinic zirconia to be 5.55 eV, 6.40 eV, and 5.42 eV, respectively. Within the GW approximation, the oxygen vacancy state in the cubic phase is found to be nondegenerate, fully occupied, and well separated from the valence and conduction bands, positioned 2.1 eV below the conduction band edge.},

abstract = {10x10 BWR segmented rods with a burnup of about 30 MWd/kgU were subjected to high power irradiation tests in the R2 reactor. Metallography on the cladding showed small incipient cracks with a depth of 10mm at the inner surface of the cladding liner after the irradiation tests. In order to investigate the incipient cracks, several post irradiation examinations were performed. Local micro-hardness of the liner was measured with an indentation force of 1 g. The results showed that the hardness was significantly increased at the inner surface facing the fuel. Electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) of the liner gave an elemental profile showing an increased amount of fission products at the inner surface and the profile agreed with the micro-hardness profile. Scanning electron microscopy showed propagation of the incipient cracks along grain boundaries. Elemental mapping with EPMA showed concentrated cadmium at the incipient cracks. Considering these observed facts, the cause of the crack formation could be stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Applied hoop stress history to the liner during the irradiation test was calculated with a fuel performance analysis code. Based on the results of the observation and calculation, the process of the crack formation and propagation was discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper we study, both with theoretical and experimental approach, the effect of iron doping in zirconia. Combining density functional theory (DFT) simulations with the experimental characterization of thin films, we show that iron is in the Fe3+ oxidation state and accordingly that the films are rich in oxygen vacancies (VO). VO favor the formation of the tetragonal phase in doped zirconia (ZrO2:Fe) and affect the density of state at the Fermi level as well as the local magnetization of Fe atoms. We also show that the Fe(2p) and Fe(3p) energy levels can be used as a marker for the presence of vacancies in the doped system. In particular the computed position of the Fe(3p) peak is strongly sensitive to the VO to Fe atoms ratio. A comparison of the theoretical and experimental Fe(3p) peak position suggests that in our films this ratio is close to 0.5. Besides the interest in the material by itself, ZrO2:Fe constitutes a test case for the application of DFT on transition metals embedded in oxides. In ZrO2:Fe the inclusion of the Hubbard U correction significantly changes the electronic properties of the system. However the inclusion of this correction, at least for the value U = 3.3 eV chosen in the present work, worsen the agreement with the measured photo-emission valence band spectra.},

abstract = {Investigation of the crack initiation stage in Zircaloy fuel cladding has shown that diffusion of an aggressive species ahead of the crack tip during the incubation time, to form an 'active path' which subsequently cracks rapidly, cannot be occurring. The appearance of such a situation arises, in these experiments, because the incubation time is not a feature of the cracking mechanism but arises because the specimen is not at thermal and chemical equilibrium with the environment at the start of the test. When efforts are taken to bring the specimen to such equilibria rapidly, before stressing, the incubation time decreases to near zero and cracking in I//2 or Cs/Cd starts almost immediately. No second phase particles or concentration of alloying elements are needed at the crack initiation site under such conditions, and crack initiation and propagation processes appear to be identical and predominantly transgranular. Organic halide contamination (e. g. methyl iodide) of the iodine results in a more aggressive environment than iodine alone, and is accompanied by characteristic fractographic features not usually otherwise seen. Such features have not been seen in PCI cracks, but only relatively small areas of such cracks have yet been examined.},

abstract = {We present a numerical study of point defects in crystalline zircon (ZrSiO4). Vacancies and interstitials of all the constituents of zircon have been considered. For each defect, the structure and the formation energies have been calculated. Calculations, using the supercell method, are based on the Density Functional Theory in the Local Density Approximation. Empirical potentials have also been considered for comparison with electronic structure results. We find a formation energy for the oxygen interstitial of 1.7 eV. This value is compatible with the experimental activation energy for oxygen diffusion in zircon, which proves an interstitial mechanism for the diffusion of oxygen in zircon. For all other defects the calculated formation energies lead to negligible thermal concentration at equilibrium.},

abstract = {Two alloys, having different oxidation behaviour (Zy4 and Zr-1NbO), have been investigated during oxidation at high temperature (743 K) and low oxygen pressure (10 kPa) by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD). Tetragonal phase content and 'pseudo-stresses' on the monoclinic phase have been measured as a function of the oxide layer thickness. The tetragonal phase contents are similar for both alloys and decreased with the oxide layer thickness. Pseudo-stresses were much more compressive on Zr-1NbO alloy, with limited changes at the corrosion kinetics transition. On cooling, the tetragonal fractions do not change, while 'pseudo-stresses' decreased in different ways for the two alloys. With respect to stress analysis, no correlation was found between 'pseudo-stresses' and tetragonal phase content. In addition, due to the thermoelastic properties of the highly anisotropic phases of the zirconia, large internal thermal stresses are expected to develop during any temperature changes. The orders of magnitude of them are similar to the stresses induced by swelling during oxidation from Zr to ZrO2. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {One of the major current challenges to nuclear energy lies in its competitiveness. To stay competitive the industry needs to reduce maintenance and fuel cycle costs, while enhancing safety features. Extended burnup is one of the methods applied to meet these objectives. However, there are a number of potential fuel failure causes related to increased burnup, as follows: 1) Corrosion of zirconium alloy cladding and the water chemistry parameters that enhance corrosion; 2) Dimensional changes of zirconium alloy components, 3) Stresses that challenge zirconium alloy ductility and the effect of hydrogen (H) pickup and redistribution as it affects ductility, 4) Fuel rod internal pressure, 5) Pellet-cladding interactions (PCI) and 6) pellet-cladding mechanical interactions (PCMI). This paper discusses current and potential failure mechanisms of these failure mechanisms.},

The microscopy-based finding is complemented by density functional theory calculations, confirming that there exists a crossover in energy between the two phases that depends on compressive strain.

abstract = {This study is concerned with structural integrity assessment of Pressure Water Reactor's (PWR) fuel rods under pellet-cladding interaction (PCI) loading condition. An important experimental and research cooperative program between EDF, AREVA-NP and the Atomic Energy Commission CEA is achieved in order to get a better understanding of the mechanisms possibly leading to PCI failure, as well as to qualify a PCI resistant rod design. The objectives of this work are: first, to improve the understanding of the pellet mechanical properties impact on cladding local loading with 3D simulations results, and second, to propose a new phenomenological rupture criterion for a better assessment of the failure risk. In this study fuel behaviour modelling under nominal and transient loading conditions is achieved with a multi-dimensional simulation tool called ALCYONE, included in the new fuel software PLEIADES currently co-developed by the CEA and EDF. Cladding loading due to mechanical interaction during power transient stage is first analysed through pellet-cladding interfacial stresses computed in the 3D simulation. Then, a 2D model is proposed in order to establish a correlation between interfacial loading and stress concentration in the cladding. In order to assess the failure risk under PCI a phenomenological criterion based on the membrane circumferential stress in the cladding and shear stresses at pellet-cladding interface is proposed. To compute the shear loading at pellet-cladding interface a new parameter (called Wr??) is introduced. Based on 3D calculations of PCI, it is shown in this paper that pellet fracture properties can have a significant effect on PCI loading. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Computation of the Fock matrix is currently the limiting factor in the application of Hartree-Fock and hybrid Hartree-Fock/density functional theories to larger systems. Computation of the Fock matrix is dominated by calculation of the Coulomb and exchange matrices. With conventional Gaussian-based methods, computation of the Fock matrix typically scales as ∼N 2.7 , where N is the number of basis functions. A hierarchical multipole method is developed for fast computation of the Coulomb matrix. This method, together with a recently described approach to computing the Hartree-Fock exchange matrix of insulators [J. Chem. Phys. 105, 2726 (1900)], leads to a linear scaling algorithm for calculation of the Fock matrix. Linear scaling computation the Fock matrix is demonstrated for a sequence of water clusters at the restricted Hartree-Fock/3-21G level of theory, and corresponding accuracies in converged total energies are shown to be comparable with those obtained from standard quantum chemistry programs. Restricted Hartree-Fock/3-21G calculations on several proteins of current interest are documented, including endothelin, charybdotoxin, and the tetramerization monomer of P53. The P53 calculation, involving 698 atoms and 3836 basis functions, may be the largest Hartree-Fock calculation to date. The electrostatic potentials of charybdotoxin and the tetramerization monomer of P53 are visualized and the results are related to molecular function. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Nuclear fuel operates in an environment that induces complex multiphysics phenomena, occurring over distances ranging from inter-atomic spacing to meters, and times scales ranging from microseconds to years. This multiphysics behavior is often tightly coupled and many important aspects are inherently multidimensional. Most current fuel modeling codes employ loose multiphysics coupling and are restricted to 2D axisymmetric or 1.5D approximations. This paper describes a new modeling tool able to simulate coupled multiphysics and multiscale fuel behavior, for either 2D axisymmetric or 3D geometries. Specific fuel analysis capabilities currently implemented in this tool are described, followed by a set of demonstration problems which include a 10-pellet light water reactor fuel rodlet, three-dimensional analysis of pellet clad mechanical interaction in the vicinity of a defective fuel pellet, coupled heat transfer and fission product diffusion in a TRISO-coated fuel particle, a demonstration of the ability to couple to lower-length scale models to account for material property variation with microstructural evolution, and a demonstration of the tool's ability to efficiently solve very large and complex problems using massively-parallel computing. A final section describes an early validation exercise, comparing simulation results to a light water reactor fuel rod experiment. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the molecular dynamics simulation method for fluids, the equations of motion for a collection of particles in a fixed volume are solved numerically. The energy, volume, and number of particles are constant for a particular simulation, and it is assumed that time averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to microcanonical ensemble averages of the same properties. In some situations, it is desirable to perform simulations of a fluid for particular values of temperature and/or pressure or under conditions in which the energy and volume of the fluid can fluctuate. This paper proposes and discusses three methods for performing molecular dynamics simulations under conditions of constant temperature and/or pressure, rather than constant energy and volume. For these three methods, it is shown that time averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to averages over the isoenthalpic–isobaric, canonical, and isothermal–isobaric ensembles. Each method is a way of describing the dynamics of a certain number of particles in a volume element of a fluid while taking into account the influence of surrounding particles in changing the energy and/or density of the simulated volume element. The influence of the surroundings is taken into account without introducing unwanted surface effects. Examples of situations where these methods may be useful are discussed.},

We used an apparatus that simulated localized stresses and strains in the sheathing such as occur due to thermal expansion and cracking of UO2 fuel pellets during a power ramp in-reactor. In the temperature range 225-550°C the combined effects of iodine and localized stresses produced a wide range of strains to failure at a given average strain rate, the upper limit of which decreased with decreasing strain rates in the range 10-3 - 10-7 sec-1. Three types of fractures were identified, namely transgranular cleavage intragranular cracking, and ductile fracture. A similar study was attempted using cesium as the corrodant but only ductile fracture resulted. However cesium-induced cracking was observed in 25 mm thick, dynamically stressed double cantilever beam specimens in the temperature range 30-225°C but not at 250 and 300°C. Small cracks in intact irradiated fuel sheaths resembled transgranular iodine-induced cracks when viewed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

The results suggest that isolated iodine ions would be most stable as anions in UO2-x but as cations in UO2+x. The stability of the I+ charge state in UO2+x prevents the association of caesium and iodine. In stoichiometric UO2, clusters of fission product species are stable, with I2 pairs being more stable than CsI pairs. However, in UO2-x CsI pairs in tri-vacancy clusters are most stable. Despite this, we predict that at all stoichiometries the precipitation of bulk CsI will be energetically favoured over solution in the fuel. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

The simulations predict equilibrium distributions of dopant cations and oxygen vacancies in the vicinity of the GBs where both materials display considerable amounts of dopant segregation. The predictions are in qualitative agreement with various experimental observations. Further analyses show that the degree of dopant segregation increases with the doping level and applied pressure in both materials. The equilibrium segregation profiles are also strongly influenced by the microscopic structure of the GBs. The high concentration of oxygen vacancies at the GB interface due to lower vacancy formation energies triggers the dopant segregation, and the final segregation profiles are largely determined by the dopant-vacancy interaction. {\textcopyright} 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract = {Many modern (Scanning) Transmission Electron Microscopes ((S)TEMs) are equipped with an energy loss spectrometer. The Electron Energy Loss (EEL) spectra collected provide an experimental method of probing the bonding within a material. With the extra addition of monochromators, the energy resolution obtainable means that even more information is revealed within the fine structure of the spectra. Interpreting the fine structure can often be aided by simulation. Density-functional theory (DFT) is one method of simulating EEL spectra. DFT allows us to simulate DOS and EEL spectra from different structures. This comparison between simulation and experiment enables us to explore how changes in the spectrum are related to changes within the sample. CASTEP is a pseudopotential DFT code which can simulate both low-loss and core-loss EEL spectra. Recent developments have resulted in a separate analysis tool, OptaDOS. This package computes various spectral properties including DOS, projected DOS, joint DOS, core-loss and low-loss EEL spectra and optical spectra. One of the important aspects of the code is the way in which the DOS is calculated. This is done via linear extrapolation or adaptive smearing, methods which are not currently available within CASTEP (or indeed any other code) and which allow detailed analysis of spectral properties. This paper summarises these developments and what they mean for the interpretation of EEL spectra.},

The fission products were introduced into the ZrO 2 matrix up to a concentration of a few at.% by ion implantation. The ZrO 2 single crystals are strongly damaged during the implantation process, and the damage creation is almost the same for Cs or I ion implantation. The location of the implanted fission products inside the host matrix depends on the nature of the impurity. A significant substitutional fraction is observed in the case of Cs ions at low concentration, whereas I ions mainly occupy random sites. These different site occupancies are likely correlated to specific impurity-defect interactions or phase formation which can affect the transport mechanisms of fission products in the confinement matrix.},

The nine polyhedral Zr-0 distances range from 2.10 to 2.56 A at ambient pressure, which represents both an increase in the average and the minimum Zr-0 distance relative to the monoclinic and orthorhombic lower-pressure forms. In addition, data obtained on an unheated sample indicate that the irreversible transition to the cotunnite phase began above 25/;Pa and 70% conversion was achieved by 48.5 GPa. Tne compressibility of cotunnite-type zirconia was found to be slightly anisotropic and a Birch-Murnaghan equation-of-state fit of the p-V data yielded a bulk modulus of 332(8) GPa with a first derivative of 2.3(4), which is in good agreement with the value predicted by previous ab initio calculations.},

abstract = {This study is concerned with the modelling of fuel behaviour and of pellet-cladding interaction (PCI). A new fuel software (PLEIADES) is currently co-developed by the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and Electricit{\'{e}} de France (EDF). This software includes a multi-dimensional FE program (ALCYONE) devoted to Pressure Water Reactors (PWR) fuel rods. PCI studies are mainly undertaken with the 3D model of ALCYONE. The objectives of this work are twofold: first, to propose a constitutive model for the fuel pellet which accounts for the stress relaxation of the material resulting from cracking and creep, second, to estimate the impact of the pellet cracking on PCI. In this paper, a mathematical formulation which couples a viscoplastic law for creep with a multi-surface plastic softening law for cracking is detailed, leading a two inelastic strains model. Mesh dependency is overcome thanks to a material parameter related to the finite element size. The 3D calculations of PCI presented in this paper show that the considered modelling of fuel cracking is consistent with the experimental knowledge available on crack development under irradiation. A parametric study is then presented which leads to the conclusion that the tangential stresses at the pellet cladding interface and hence the risk of PCI failure are significantly reduced when the fuel tensile strength is divided by two. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Hydrogen isotopes in fuel cladding of nuclear power reactor are of much interest in relation to the secondary hydriding of claddings, tritium content in spent fuels, and other issues. Using nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), we performed out-of-reactor analysis on the radial distribution of deuterium in Zr-liner zircaloy-2 claddings. Three specimens of the cladding were thermally charged with deuterium gas at 673 K in advance. One was quenched in water (sample 1) and the others were gradually cooled to 433 K (samples 2 and 3). The NRA showed that the radial distribution of deuterium was flat from the inside to the outside in the sample 1 tube. As diffusion of deuterium is much restricted after quenching, the distribution observed is considered to be the same as that before quenching. In samples 2 and 3, on the other hand, a sharp peak was formed in the zirconium liner near the Zr-zircaloy-2 interface. The peak concentration in the liner was several times as large as that in zircaloy-2. This indicated that the migration towards Zr-liner in the gradual cooling resulted in the redistribution of deuterium. The redistribution can be explained by a slight difference in the terminal solubility of deuterium in the two materials, Zr and zircaloy-2. The large effect of this slight difference on the redistribution of hydrogen isotopes is also discussed.},

abstract = {One of the important operations in nuclear power plants is load-following in which the imbalance in axial power distribution induces xenon oscillations. These oscillations must be maintained within acceptable limits otherwise the nuclear power plant could become unstable. Therefore, bounded xenon oscillation is considered to be a constraint for the load-following operation. On the other hands, precursors produce delayed neutrons which are important with respect to reactor period and control, but xenon concentration and precursors densities cannot be measured directly. In this paper, the non-linear sliding mode observer which has the robust characteristics facing the parameters uncertainties and disturbances is proposed based on the two point nuclear reactor model equations with three groups of the delayed neutrons to estimate the xenon concentration and delayed neutrons precursor densities of the pressurized-water nuclear reactor (PWR) using reactor power measurements. The stability analysis is provided by means of the Lyapunov approach, thus the system is guaranteed to be stable over a wide range. The employed method is easy to implement. This estimation is done taking into account the effects of reactivity feedback due to temperature and xenon concentration. Simulation results clearly show that the sliding mode observer follows the actual system variables accurately and is satisfactory in the presence of the parameter uncertainties and disturbances.},

abstract = {This chapter focuses on the modeling of pellet-cladding interaction (PCI) in pressurized water reactor under nominal and transient loading conditions. Scientific results proposed in this chapter have already been published and are mainly based on an important experimental and research cooperative program between EDF, AREVA, and the Atomic Energy Commission CEA which was initiated to get a better understanding of the mechanisms possibly leading to PCI failure, as well as to qualify a PCI-resistant rod design.In the first part, the phenomenological aspects of PCI are detailed with a brief bibliographic review of modeling approaches developed in France and abroad.In the second part, experimental approach of PCI is discussed, with the objective of presenting an overall vision of the knowledge coming from postirradiation analyses of industrial fuel rods and also power ramp test results. Due to the large number of nonlinear phenomena involved in PCI behavior, it is however very difficult to get a full understanding of the mechanisms at hand from experimental results only. A detailed modeling approach is necessary. Among the other motivations which have led to the development of PCI modeling, we can list: the difficulty and the cost of instrumented PCI experiments, the need for tools to develop representative laboratory tests, and also the ambition to use numerical simulation to reduce the development and qualification periods of a product and to optimize fuel rod design.In the third part of this chapter, PCI modeling and numerical simulation are presented via the description of the thermal, mechanical, and physical problems that need to be solved and the knowledge linked to each of the contributing mechanisms. Attention is focused on the multidimensional PCI modeling environment PLEIADES codeveloped by the Atomic Energy Commission CEA and EDF in the framework of the tripartite cooperation with AREVA. Improvements brought about by the use of a multidimensional PCI modeling are detailed, particularly with regard to the simulation of the coupling between gaseous swelling and mechanical behavior of the fuel pellet.In the last part, the contribution of modeling to a better understanding of PCI is detailed with simulation results. For each elementary mechanism, at the fuel element scale, a discussion is proposed on the following items: comparison between computation and available measurements, first-order parameters based on sensitivity analyses, the type of modeling needed, and the contribution of 1D, 2D, or 3D approaches. Through these results, it appears that PCI simulation provides a quantitative assessment of the competition between nonlinear phenomena taking place in the fuel element under irradiation. Finally, a PCI failure risk criterion based on a theoretical approach is proposed, its validation and limits are discussed. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

@phdthesis{Xia2010,
abstract = {Interatomic potential and quantum mechanical simulation techniques have been applied to both the bulk and surfaces of yttrium-stabilized cubic zirconia (YSZ) with special reference to its role in partial oxidation reaction at high temperature. The stabilities of pure ZrO2 phases and surfaces have been examined. The bulk structures of low pressure phases are reproduced with the observed order of stability: monoclinic >tetragonal >cubic zirconia. The relative stability of plane cubic ZrO2 surfaces is predicted to be (111)c >(110)c >(100)c >(310)c. In addition, the stability of topological surfaces is found to be reduced with the coordination number of Zr ions at the topological sites in the order: plane >step >kink >corner. The dispersion of defects in YSZ systems has been studied, considering both the dopant content and surface segregation. In the bulk, the yttrium dopants tend to form a pair with two yttrium atoms close to each other and preferentially occupying the 1st or 2nd nearest neighbour (NN) sites to the compensating oxygen vacancy. At the surface, yttrium segregates to the top layers (up to 4-5 {\AA}) of the dominant (111) surface of YSZ. The composition of the outermost surface of YSZ is predicted to be independent of Y bulk concentration and reach a maximum Y/Zr ratio of 1:1. In relation to catalytic oxidation, the interaction between oxygen molecules and the (111) surfaces of pure c-ZrO2 and YSZ have been investigated using quantum- mechanical DFT-GGA methods. The adsorption states of oxygen and the pathways for dissociation have been indentified on the plane and stepped (111) surfaces. In general, the creation of oxygen vacancies by yttrium doping provides an active site for oxygen adsorption. In addition, the low-coordinated Zr cations on the YSZ surfaces can attract strongly reduced oxygen species and the most stable adsorption state of oxygen is adopted to achieve a higher bond saturation of the neighbouring Zr site.},

Tailored concentration profiles of any desired species are first created in the near-surface region of polished samples by ion implantation. The impact of either thermal annealing or simulated fission is then precisely determined by depth profiling with high-performance secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Comparison of iodine migration in UO2 wafers that had been ion-implanted to fluences spanning five orders of magnitude has revealed subtle radiation-damage effects and a pronounced concentration dependence for thermal diffusion. At concentrations above ???1016atoms/cm3 much of the iodine became trapped, likely in microscopic bubbles. True thermal diffusion coefficients for iodine in polycrystalline UO2 have been derived by modelling the low-fluence data. ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {To investigate iodine stress corrosion cracking on the behavior of Zircaloy tubing, a standard test procedure with internally pressurized creep specimens (I-SCC standard test) and a split-ring test (I-SCC laboratory test) were developed. The threshold value for brittle cracking in iodine is 10 $\sim$* g iodine per square centimetre. The uniform elongation shows a clear minimum in its dependence on strain rate. Basal pole orientations in the range of ± 50 to ± 70 deg relative to the radial direction are the most I-SCC sensitive textures. The I-SCC process occurs in several stages; incubation, crack nucleation, and propagation. A thermodynamic eyaluation indicates that I-SCC only occurs when zirconium iodides condense on the Zircaloy surface. Results show that comparisons of the I-SCC susceptibility of tubing manufactured in different manners should be made at the same point on the strain rate versus uniform elongation curves; for example, at the strain rate with the minimum of uniform elongation.},

abstract = {TiO2 has been intensively studied as a wide band-gap transition metal oxide partially due to the multi-valence nature of its cation. Here, density-functional theory calculations within the supercell approximation are carried out to determine the preferred charge state of point defects in rutile TiO2. The first component of this work is to investigate the dependence of the defect formation energies on supercell size and the electrostatic Makov-Payne correction. The results show that the Makov-Payne correction improves the convergence of defect formation energies as a function of supercell size for positively charged titanium interstitials and negatively charged titanium vacancies. However, in the case of positively charged oxygen vacancies, applying the Makov-Payne correction gives the wrong sign for the defect formation energy correction. This is attributed to the shallow nature of the transition levels for this defect in TiO2. Finally, we combine the calculated defect formation energies with thermodynamic data to evaluate the influence of temperature on the relative stabilities of point defects. The results indicate that when the Makov- Payne correction is applied, a stable charge transition occurs for titanium interstitials. In addition, as the temperature increases, the dominant point defect in TiO2 changes from oxygen vacancies to titanium interstitials.},

The relaxation volume of charged point defects or the partial molar volume of ions in solution are two such examples. However, the total energy and therefore the pressure of charged systems is not uniquely defined when periodic boundary conditions are employed. This problem is tightly related to the origin of the electrostatic potential in periodic systems. This effect can be easily observed by modifying the electrostatic convention or modifying the local ionic potential details. We propose an approach to uniquely define the pressures in charged supercells with the use of the absolute deformation potentials. Only with such a definition could the ab initio calculations provide meaningful values for the relaxation volumes and for the elastic interactions for charged defects in semiconductors or ions in solution. The proposed scheme allows one to calculate sensible data even when charge neutrality is not enforced, thus going beyond the classical force-field-based approaches.},

abstract = {Recently, using first principles theoretical methods, we have predicted that unconventional compounds and crystal structures may form via the chemical transmutation that occurs during radioactive decay (e.g. rock salt 137BaCl formation from the [small beta]- decay of 137CsCl) (C. Jiang, C.R. Stanek, N. A. Marks, K. E. Sickafus and B. P. Uberuaga, Phys. Rev. B: Condens. Matter Mater. Phys., 2009, 79, 132110). We refer to this phenomenon as "radioparagenesis". In this paper, we explore the concept of applying radioparagenesis to the evaluation of long time scale crystalline nuclear waste form performance as well as to the design of chemically robust waste forms. For waste form evaluation, we specifically discuss: (1) the variation in the properties of radioparagenetic phases that govern waste form performance, as compared to conventional materials, (2) the volumetric change associated with radioparagenetic phase formation (using Cs1-xBaxCl as an example), which may lead to waste form cracking and (3) thermodynamic and mechanical stability of radioparagenetic phases. For waste form identification, we introduce the possibility of "backward design", where the chemical evolution of the waste form is explicitly considered with the goal of achieving a defined end state. The decay of 90SrO2 to 90ZrO2 is provided as a demonstrative example. We use density functional theory to examine the performance and design of waste forms. Finally, we propose accelerated experiments to rapidly verify the formation of radioparagenetic phases, which has not occurred to date.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Chemical Society.We show that hydrogen adsorption leads to completely different dissociation mechanisms on extended zirconia surfaces or on zirconia nanoparticles. The reaction of molecular hydrogen with various forms of tetragonal ZrO2 (bulk, regular (101), and stepped (156) surfaces and nanoparticles of 0.9-1.9 nm size) has been studied by means of density functional theory calculations. The heterolytic H2 splitting, in which Zr-H- and O-H+ bonds are formed, is energetically favorable on the extended surfaces. This mechanism does not lead to a chemical reduction of the oxide. Incorporation of the H species from the surface into the bulk results in the formation of a proton and an electron trapped at a Zr ion (Zr3+) but is energetically very unfavorable. Completely different is the behavior of zirconia nanoparticles where the reductive homolytic splitting, in which two OH bonds are formed and two electrons are transferred to Zr3+ sites, is the preferred adsorption mechanism (exothermic reaction). This shows that under-coordination and nanostructuring may have dramatic effects on the reactivity of this oxide toward hydrogen, turning the nonreducible bulk zirconia into a reducible material when prepared in form of nanoparticles.},

The results predicted a transition from monoclinic structure to a fluorite-type cubic structure at the pressure of 37 GPa.

abstract = {Zirconia produced by the oxidation of zirconium alloys in nuclear reactors exhibits a phase transition under ionic irradiation, simulating a neutron irradiation. To understand the mechanism responsible for this irradiation driven phase transition, different kinds of projectiles were used to irradiate pure monoclinic zirconia samples. The evolution of these irradiated samples as a function of dpa has been studied using grazing X-ray diffraction. The Rietveld method has been applied on collected X-ray diffraction diagrams to study the phase produced under irradiation and the kinetics of its formation. Even at high dpa values, only the monoclinic and tetragonal phases were used to simulate X-ray diffraction diagrams. No amorphisation of zirconia was observed. The evolution of unit cells and short range strains in both phases under irradiation leads us to think that the irradiation driven transition is martensitic. Supposing that the inelastic stopping power in sub-cascades is responsible for the irradiation driven phase transition, we propose a model based on the Landau-Ginzburg effective hamiltonian to explain both the m→t transition observed under irradiation and the t→m transition measured during isochronal annealing after irradiation. {\textcopyright}2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This is in contrast to previous space charge models, which utilized a continuum approximation. The crystal-plane-resolved picture of the space charge is discussed in detail. It is found that the results from the parallel-sheets model resemble closely those of the continuum model. We find this to be the case even for the polar (111) orientation of cubic zirconia, despite the fact that continuum approximations implicitly assume a homogeneous system. We also examine the effect of yttrium dopant segregation on the space charge utilizing the parallel-sheets model. It is found that dopant segregation tends to decrease the width of the oxygen vacancy depletion layer that occurs in oxidizing atmosphere, and that it tends to increase the accumulation of vacancies in reducing atmosphere.},

abstract = {The knowledge of the partial pressure of fission product iodine is important for evaluating the FCCI (fuel cladding chemical interaction) in FBR. Thermodynamical analysis shows that iodine is believed to react with cesium so strongly that the partial pressure of iodine is kept too low to cause FCCI. A molecule of cesium iodide is, however, excited by radiation in the reactor and dissociates into radical and ion. In this work, the radiation effect on the partial pressure of iodine is theoretically studied for the gaseous cesium-iodine system. Fission fragment flux is considered as the radiation and the iodine partial pressure is evaluated based on the theory of gaseous reaction. The results of the calculation show that the partial pressure of iodine can be increased enough to cause FCCI in the radiation field. In the case of the FBR fuel pin, the partial pressure of iodine under radiation conditions can be calculated to be $\sim$ 10-2Pa ($\sim$10-7atm), which is higher than that of the non-radiation condition $\sim$10-9Pa ($\sim$10-14atm). These calculations were carried out under the assumption that the cladding inner surface temperature was 873 K (600°C) and the oxygen potential was -418 kJ/mol (-100 kcal/mol). {\textcopyright} 1983.},

Some alloys that resisted cracking in iodine before irradiation became susceptible after receiving neutron fluences exceeding 2 × 1024n/m2, (E > 1 MeV) in the proximity of UO2 fuel but not after irradiation to higher fluences in air. Control tests showed that fission products adhering to or implanted into the surfaces of irradiated tubing did not cause cracking in the absence of deliberately added iodine. Experiments confirmed the strong influence of residual stresses on the cracking of cold drawn unirradiated tubes under static applied stress. Treatments that decreased the tensile residual stresses (roller straightening, shot peening, and irradiation to a low fluence of fast neutrons) reduced the likelihood of stress corrosion cracking in iodine vapor. After Zircaloy has reacted chemically with iodine, the Zircaloy picks up hydrogen rapidly. It was also observed that hydrided Zircaloy has a higher resistance to iodine-induced cracking than unhy-drided Zircaloy. Surface coatings of graphite and baked poly-dimethyl-siloxane grease that protect Zircaloy from iodine attack have been tested and are discussed here.},

Once accurate elastic constants were calculated, elastic anisotropies, sound velocities, Debye temperatures, malleability, and other measurable physical properties were determined for the studied systems. The elastic properties suggested metallic bonding with intermediate malleability, between brittle and ductile, for the studied Heusler compounds. To address the effect of off-stoichiometry on the mechanical properties, the virtual crystal approximation (VCA) was used to calculate the elastic constants.

The cracking mechanism is discussed in relation to chemical factors. Cesium and iodine are released as fission products and form CsI but its dissociation iodine pressure p(I) is many orders of magnitude greater than chemical thermodynamic calculations predict, due to radiolysis. This enhanced p(I) can form ZrI4 in regions where Zr is exposed (not protected by surface scale) and a van Arkel vapour transport reaction then causes rapid Zr transport from localised cladding areas, i.e. pitting, which later becomes a crack site. Requirements are a critical strain rate (which cracks protective scale), iodine pressure and time, i.e. a power ramp. Factors include that a stress caused by a power ramp may relax before the required gap chemistry is achieved and that a ramp also releases short-lived I and Cs fission products which add to the iodine pressure available.},

abstract = {The segmented expanding mandrel test is modified to provide additional information on the localized stresses and strains during ramp-hold tests. A chamfered specimen is designed with four flats on the outer diameter for the purpose of creating sectors of variable wall thickness which establishes a more nearly plane strain state in the thinnest-gauge sections. Ramp-hold tests conducted in 40 MPa of iodine at 325°C show that at a measured diametral strain of 0.8%, chamfered specimens fail while regular tubing specimens require diametral strains of 2% or greater for failure. Calculations made with a two-dimensional, finite elements code show that at a measured diametral strain of 0.8%, the local strains in the clad ID over the segment interfaces are nearly identical for the regular and chamfered samples while the local stress in the chamfered sample is 15% greater. Results suggest that the smaller diametral failure strain of the chamfered specimen at low measured diametral strains is mainly due to its near plane strain condition and the higher hoop stresses resulting therefrom. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

The effective diffusion coefficients for cesium were found to be comparable to those for xenon and roughly an order of magnitude smaller than those for iodine and tellurium over the temperature range studied. Acitvation energies for diffusion of the more volatile elements as derived from analysis within the Booth model were 156 ± 45 (Xe), 122 ± 133 (I), 115 ± 11 (Te) and 99 ± 11 (Cs) kcal/mol. The activation energies for Mo and Tc found by a similar treatment were 353 ± 24 and 205 ± 42 kcal/mol, respectively, and are indicative of a fairly complex mechanism for release of these elements.

abstract = {Interest remains high regarding the effects of zirconium hydride precipitates on the ductility of reactor Zircaloy components, particularly in irradiated material. Previous studies have reported that ductility reductions are much greater at room temperature compared to reactor component temperatures. It is often concluded that the effects of irradiation dominate the ductility reduction observed in test specimens, although there is no consensus as to whether hydriding effects are additive. Many of the tests reported in the literature are difficult to interpret due to variations in test specimen geometry and material history. In this paper, we present the results of an experimental program aimed at clearly describing the combined effects of irradiation and hydriding on ductility parameters under conditions of a realistic test specimen design and well characterized hydride content, distribution and orientation. Experiments were conducted at 295 and 605 K, respectively on Zircaloy-2 tubing segments containing 10-800 ppm hydrogen and neutron fluences between 0-9 x 1025 n m-2 (E> 1 MeV). Tests utilized the well proven localized ductility specimen which applies plane strain tension in the hoop direction of the tubing segment. In all cases, hydrides were also oriented in the hoop or circumferential direction and were uniformly distributed across the tubing wall. Results indicate that at 605 K, the ductility of irradiated material was almost independent of hydride content, retaining above 4% uniform elongation and 25% reduction in an area for the highest fluences and hydrogen contents. Even at 295 K, measurable ductility was retained for irradiated material with up to 600 ppm hydrogen. In the paper, results of fractographic analyses and strain rate are also discussed. We conclude that at reactor component operating temperatures, radiation damage controls the ductility of Zircaloy-2 for conditions of these tests up to hydride levels of at least 800 ppm, and probably much higher. At room temperature the effect of hydride content and radiation damage appear to be additive.},

abstract = {The temperature dependence of Raman spectra of cubic yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) for three yttria concentrations (10, 15, and 20 wt %) is investigated in the range 40–1470 K. The variation of the spectra with temperature implies that first-order scattering (one-phonon processes) is dominant in this material, providing further evidence that the broad features observed in the spectra are caused mainly by partial lattice disorder rather than by combination (higher-order) processes. The high-temperature phase of YSZ is entirely stable in this range and remains cubic throughout. The temperature-induced frequency shifts of the band at ∼600 cm-1 (attributed to the F2g zone-center optic mode) are determined for the three different yttria concentrations. Furthermore, using uniaxial stress data as well, the volume contribution to such shifts is calculated and compared to the lattice anharmonicity contribution. It is found that the volume contribution is larger than the total effect (by a factor of about 2) for all three compositions at 300 K, implying that the bonding in cubic YSZ has ionic character.},

Data are presented for monoclinic and tetragonal polymorphs, in the form of Brouwer diagrams, to show the defect response at oxygen pressures ranging from 10−35to 100atm. The oxygen pressure required for stoichiometry in monoclinic ZrO2is approximately 10−7.5atm, at both low and high iodine concentrations, whereas for tetragonal ZrO2, it increases from 10−10to 10−6.5atm as the iodine concentration is increased from 10−5to 10−3atoms/formula unit. The dominant defects in monoclinic ZrO2are IO•charge-compensated by I‴Zrat low oxygen pressures, and a combination of I‴Zr, IO•••and Ii•defects at high oxygen pressures. In tetragonal ZrO2, the dominant defects at low oxygen pressures are e′, VO••and IO•. At high oxygen pressures, h•and I‴Zrare dominant, with additional charge-compensation from V″Zrdefects when iodine concentrations are low. The concentration of IOdefects in the tetragonal phase decrease with increasing oxygen pressure above stoichiometry, demonstrating competition between iodine and oxygen for occupancy of the anion site. This has implications for fuel and cladding designs that are resistant to iodine-SCC.},

The objective of the project is to investigate failure propensity and characteristics of 20 unpressurized fuel rods of typical 8 × 8 BWR design when subjected to overpower ramp operation after having completed prior extended irradiations (9 to 23 GWd/MTU accumulated peak burnups) containing idealized cyclic power-level variations. All irradiations were performed in the Studsvik R2 reactor in conditions simulating BWR coolant temperatures and pressures. Fuel rod design variables included fuel-cladding gap size, initial cladding heat treatment, and fuel density. The power ramping tests produced 11 failures (leaking rods) out of the 20 total in highly-consistent patterns strongly linking ramping performance to integral effects created during the preceding extended irradiations - i.e., the results indicated power shock was more dominant than peak ramp power. Permanent cladding deformation was small (generally 0.05-0.1) and burnup dependence of failure appeared negligible for the range studied. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

abstract = {Zirconia, ZrO2, produced by the oxidation of zirconium alloys in nuclear reactors, possesses a high stability under neutron irradiation. No amorphisation of yttrium-stabilised zirconia has been observed even at high dpa values (approximate to 100 dpa). In pure monoclinic zirconia, a phase transition monoclinic -->cubic (tetragonal) induced by irradiation has already been observed, The aim of this work is to study in detail the mechanism responsible for this transition. For that purpose, different kinds of irradiations with electrons (to study point defects) and low energetic ions (to study clusters due to collision cascades) have been performed on zirconia samples. A local probe (Raman spectroscopy) and a nonlocal probe (grazing X-ray diffraction) have been used to characterise the phase formed during irradiation, which is clearly the tetragonal phase. For the ionic implantation, the grazing X-ray diffraction permits to separate effects due to the ballistic collisions and the implantation peak. Using this method, it was possible to show that the profile of the tetragonal phase was only linked to the dpa profile. This result associated to the results obtained by the Raman spectroscopy (broadening of Raman peaks) shows that the phase transition may be induced by clusters formed near the collision cascades.

Investigation of oxygen migration pathways by ab initio metadynamics simulations show the occurrence of multiple-vacancy concerted jumps in correspondence of an unstable arrival state for a single vacancy jump. Furthermore, in the case of single vacancy jump, we have observed a strong dependence of the activation barrier on the position of the other vacancies, similar in strength to the dependence of the activation energy on the presence of nearest-neighbors yttrium ions, customarily assumed to constitute a blocking site for vacancy migration.

abstract = {Fuel centreline temperatures measured under transient conditions are reported. These show that also at burnups as high as 4.5% FIMA the onset temperature for thermal gas release is close to 1200°C. At constant linear power the 1200°C isotherm moves outwards with burnup due to the development of a thermal barrier at the pellet rim and a general degradation in the fuel thermal conductivity. This causes the observed burnup enhancement of gas release. Using radial temperature profiles constructed from experimental data, grain growth and Xe diffusion during a power transient at high burnup are reexamined. It is found that grain growth is slower than predicted for steady-state irradiation conditions. The effective Xe diffusion coefficient, DXe, in the transient tests with hold times of 40, 42 and 62 h is given by DXe = 1.9 × 10-8 exp(-21890/T) cm2 s-1, T in K. For the tests with a 4 h hold time, DXe is giv by DXe = 2.5 × 10-9 exp(-21050/T) below 1570°C, but by the former equation above 1600°C. In the long transient tests, the increase in the DXe below 1570°C is attributed to the annealing of gas traps in the oxide lattice. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

The ratio of applied axial stress ($\sigma$a) to applied hoop stress ($\sigma$h) was varied between zero and infinity by axially loading the pressurized specimens. The susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) varied in a complex manner with stress ratio ($\sigma$a) ($\sigma$h) in the range 0 < ($\sigma$a) ($\sigma$h) < 1 and was substantially greater under hoop tension ($\sigma$a)/($\sigma$h) = 0) than under axial tension ($\sigma$a)/($\sigma$h) = ∞). It is concluded that the influence of stress ratio in the range 0 < ($\sigma$a)/($\sigma$h) < 1 most likely arises through its effect on the circumferential strain rate. On the other hand, the difference between the SCC susceptibilities under axial and hoop loading is probably attributable to fabrication-induced anisotropy of the grain orientation and shape. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

Thermal-neutron fission: cumulative yields for 227Th, 229Th, 233U, 235U, 239Pu, 241Pu, 241Am, 242Am, 245Cm, 249Cf, 251Cf, 254Es, and 255Fm; independent yieds for 233U, 235U, 237Np, 238U, and 239Pu. Fast-neutron fission: cumulativ yields for 227Ac, 231Pa, 232Th, 233U, 235U, 237Np, 238U, and 239Pu; independent yields for 235U and 238U. 14-MeV-neutron fission: cumulative yields for 231Pa, 232Th, 233U, 235U, 237Np, 238U, and 239Pu; independent yields for 232Th, 233U, 235U, 238U, and 239Pu. 11-MeV-neutron fission: cumulative yields for 232Th. 3-MeV-neutron fission: cumulative yields for 231Pa, 232Th, and 238U. 1.1-MeV-neutron fission: cumulative yields for 237Np. From these experimental values the unknown independent yields are deduced empirically for thermal-neutron fission of 233U, 235U, 239Pu, and 241Pu; the fast fission of 232Th, 233U, 235U, 238U, 239Pu, 240Pu, and 241Pu (the chain yields for 240Pu and 241Pu used at this energy being predictions); and the 14-MeV-neutron fission of 232Th, 233U, 235U, and 238U. Finally, by the fitting of the preceding information to condition equations derived from the conservation laws, adjusted sets of chain and independent yields are calculated for thermal fission of 233U, 235U, 239Pu, and 241Pu; fast fission of 232Th, 233U, 235U, 238U, 239Pu, and 241Pu; and 14-MeV fission of 232Th, 233U, 235U, and 238U. The literature search is probably complete to the end of 1975; some 1976 results are included.

abstract = {The transmutation and induced activity of W in the armor and first wall of a fusion reactor were calculated for various blanket compositions, taking account of multiple step reactions. Neutron spectra calculated with ANISN showed that the flux of low energy neutrons at both armor and first wall using water coolant is fairly high compared to liquid Li, He gas and FliBe coolants. About 4% of W transmutes to Re for the W armor of all blankets after 10 MWy/ m2 irradiation and is not affected by the difference in blanket composition. On the other hand, W in the first wall substantially transmutes to Re followed by Os for the water cooled blanket. For the longer irradiation, W was predicted to transmute to Os base alloy. The induced activity of the W armor is hardly influenced by the neutron spectrum. The formation of 186mRe and 186Re controlling the induced activity of the armor for long cooling times is not significant from the viewpoint of the safety level. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The high-temperature structure of zirconia was studied by powder neutron diffraction up to 2400°C. The boundaries of the domain of the nonstoichiometric tetragonal form are defined. They are consistent with a tetragonal-cubic transition at 2350°C for stoichiometric zirconia. The changes in the structural parameters of the tetragonal form (unit-cell, positional parameters and thermal B factors) with temperature give evidence of medium zirconium and oxygen mobilities. The oxygen ions are, however, always more mobile than the zirconium ions. An enhancement with temperature of the structural an-isotropy tends to weaken the weaker of the two distinct Zr-0 bonds of the tetragonal zirconia. It results in the transformation into the cubic form which is accompanied by a change in unit-cell volume; this change becomes sharper as the composition tends toward stoichiometry. This transition is probably followed by an increase of the ionic mobility.},

abstract = {The stability of the fast ion conducting cubic phase of zirconia has been investigated using atomistic molecular dynamics to determine the effect of clustering of dopant ions for zirconia containing 11 mol% of yttria or scandia stabilizing additive. Large clusters of dopant ions entrap vacancies within the dopant cluster, which increases the average oxygen coordination of the zirconium ions. Not only does this reduce the number of vacancies available for ionic conduction, but it also destabilizes the cubic phase, causing a significant reduction in ionic conductivity as a whole. Using scandia as a stabilizing additive provides better conductivity than yttria, despite the fact that yttria causes a lower coordination for zirconium ions. Cationic migration in the cubic phase occurs too slowly to be captured in molecular dynamics simulations; instead, energy calculations are made, which predict that yttrium dopants exhibit stronger mutually repulsive interactions than scandium ions, which impede the energetically favorable phase segregation process. As a result, aging of yttria stabilized zirconia will proceed at a slower rate than scandia stabilized zirconia. {\textcopyright} Published by Elsevier B.V.},

@article{ElKadiri2013,
abstract = {Using combined Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and optical microscopy, this paper suggests that breakaway oxidation of Zircaloy is caused by the change of circumferential stress sign from compressive to tensile, which triggers catastrophic cracks to propagate from the oxide free surface toward the oxide-metal interface. The stress sign changes at a critical oxide thickness, which depends on the circumferential stress at the interface. This biaxial interfacial stress is promoted by a lattice expansion stress that accompanies the tetragonal to monoclinic crystal phase transition. In contrast with current research in the literature, this allotropic transformation is suggested to be beneficial, not detrimental, because it contributes to retard the thresholds for the change of circumferential stress sign, and thus breakaway oxidation. The tetragonal phase was revealed to localize at the interface and adopt the shape of prismatic isosceles triangles detected at early stages of oxidation. These growth morphologies are consistent with a cationic oxidation mechanism. Upon phase transition, the monoclinic variant quickly dominates the oxide scale above the interfacial regions and forces the overall oxidation to proceed by an anionic diffusion mechanism. The results of Raman spectroscopy compared well with those of atomic force microscopy. ?? 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Revisions are based on new structural data, empirical bond strength-bond length relationships, and plots of (1) radii vs volume, (2) radii vs coordination number, and (3) radii vs oxidation state. Factors which affect radii additivity are polyhedral distortion, partial occupancy of cation sites, covalence, and metallic character. Mean Nb5+-O and Mo6+-O octahedral distances are linearly dependent on distortion. A decrease in cation occupancy increases mean Li+-O, Na+-O, and Ag+-O distances in a predictable manner. Covalence strongly shortens Fe2+-X, Co2+-X, Ni2+-X, Mn2+-X, Cu+-X, Ag+-X, and M-H- bonds as the electronegativity of X or M decreases. Smaller effects are seen for Zn2+-X, Cd2+-X, In2+-X, pb2+-X, and TI+-X. Bonds with delocalized electrons and therefore metallic character, e.g. Sm-S, V-S, and Re-O, are significantly shorter than similar bonds with localized electrons.},

The relevance of various phenomena affecting gas behaviour is evaluated. The current status of modelling of the behaviour of intragranular gas is considered in light of the present findings. Simple calculations showed that the conventional approximation for the effective diffusion coefficient does not adequately describe the gas behaviour under transient conditions, when bubble coarsening plays a key role in the release. The difference in the release fraction, compared with a more mechanistic approach, could be as large as 30%. A number of recommendations regarding possible defects in the mechanistic approach to modelling of intragranular gas are highlighted. The lack of an effective numerical method for solving the set of relevant non-linear differential equations is shown to be a serious obstacle in implementing the mechanistic models for fission gas release (FGR), in integral fuel performance codes.},

The aggressive species is present as gaseous iodine thermally released in the gap, and as recoil implanted iodine in the cladding. The aim of this work is to determine the respective roles of gaseous and implanted iodine on the SCC phenomenon. Quantities of iodine involved during a power transient in PCI conditions are then evaluated for a two PWR cycle irradiated fuel rod. An iodine recoil-implant profile in the cladding is first established. This calculation, in addition to some complementary SCC tests presented elsewhere, shows that implanted iodine seems to have no influence on the SCC susceptibility of the material. On the other hand, a detailed calculation of the surface concentration of free iodine in the inter-pellet area and in the radial cracks of the pellet confirms that, upon power transients, enough gaseous iodine is released to induce cladding SCC failures. Thus, thermally released iodine appears to be the chemical active species responsible for SCC.},

abstract = {Oxidation tests with hydrogen present in three different states were performed: (i) Hydrogen in solid solution in the zirconium alloy, corresponding to the initial oxidation prior to precipitation of hydrides. (ii) Uniformly distributed hydrides, simulating a situation where hydrides start to precipitate and (iii) massive surface hydride, claimed to be the main cause of accelerated oxidation. The pre-hydrided samples and a reference (REF) sample were oxidised in steam in a static autoclave at 400°C and 10 MPa for 3, 10 and 25 days. The oxide formed was characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Based on the results obtained, it is concluded that the oxidation of massive zirconium hydride resembles the oxidation of zirconium metal. This fact shows that the commonly observed accelerated oxidation of zirconium alloys cannot be due to an increased oxidation rate of the hydride compared to the metal,but must require a combined effect of, for example interfacial roughness and hydride precipitation. The results are discussed in relation to the mechanism of corrosion and hydriding of zirconium alloys. {\textcopyright}2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {In the energy-structure paradigm, we analyzed the defects that can arise in tetragonal zirconium oxide (T-ZrO 2 ) involving the hydrogen atom or the hydrogen molecule using density functional theory. Our results indicate that the dominant hydrogen defect under reducing conditions is, a complex formed between the hydride ion and a doubly charged oxygen vacancy. This result is consistent with the experimental observation that under reducing conditions, the solubility of hydrogen is proportional to the degree of hypostoichiometry of T-ZrO 2 . Under oxidizing conditions we found three different hydrogen defects, each predominating in a specific range of the chemical potential of electrons. Starting from the valence band top toward the conduction band bottom, these defects are the interstitial proton, a complex formed between two hydrogen species and a zirconium vacancy with a net effective charge of (2-), and finally a complex similar to the latter but with a net effective charge of (4-),. In the two hydrogens exist in the form of hydroxyl groups, while in they exist in the form of a hydrogen molecule. In addition, we found that up to three hydrogen species can favorably accumulate in a zirconium vacancy under oxidizing conditions. The clustering of hydrogen in cation vacancies can be a precursor for the deleterious effects of hydrogen on the mechanical properties and stability of metal oxides, in analogy with hydrogen embrittlement in metals. Finally we observed a red-shift and a blue-shift for the vibrational frequencies of all the hydroxyl groups and all the hydrogen molecules, respectively, in T-ZrO 2 when compared to the gas phase frequencies. This is an important characteristic for guiding future experimental efforts to detect and identify hydrogen defects in T-ZrO 2 . The insights presented in this work advance our predictive understanding of the degradation behavior of T-ZrO 2 as a corrosion resistant passive layer, as a gate dielectric and in biomedical applications.},

abstract = {During operation, nuclear fuel rods are immersed in the primary water, caus- ing waterside corrosion and consequent hydrogen ingress. In this review, the mechanisms of corrosion and hydrogen pickup and the role of alloy selection in minimizing both phenomena are considered on the basis of two principal characteristics: the pretransition kinetics and the loss of oxide protective- ness at transition. In zirconium alloys, very small changes in composition or microstructure can cause significant corrosion differences so that corrosion performance is strongly alloy dependent. The alloys show different, but re- producible, subparabolic pretransition kinetics and transition thicknesses. A mechanism for oxide growth and breakup based on a detailed study of the oxide structure can explain these results. Through the use of the recently de- veloped coupled current charge compensation model of corrosion kinetics and hydrogen pickup, the subparabolic kinetics and the hydrogen fraction can be rationalized:Hydrogen pickup increases when electron transport de- creases, requiring hydrogen ingress to close the reaction.},

abstract = {Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations of intrinsic point defect properties in zinc oxide were performed in order to remedy the influence of finite-size effects and the improper description of the band structure. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with empirical self-interaction corrections (GGA+U) was applied to correct for the overestimation of covalency intrinsic to GGA-DFT calculations. Elastic as well as electrostatic image interactions were accounted for by application of extensive finite-size scaling and compensating charge corrections. Size-corrected formation enthalpies and volumes as well as their charge state dependence have been deduced. Our results partly confirm earlier calculations but reveal a larger number of transition levels: (1) For both the zinc interstitial as well as the oxygen vacancy, transition levels are close to the conduction band minimum. (2) The zinc vacancy shows a transition rather close to the valence band maximum and another one near the middle of the calculated band gap. (3) For the oxygen interstitials, transition levels occur both near the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Laminarinases hydrolyzing the $\beta$-1,3-linkage of glucans play essential roles in microbial saccharide degradation. Here we report the crystal structures at 1.65-1.82 {\AA}resolution of the catalytic domain of laminarinase from the thermophile Thermotoga maritima with various space groups in the ligand-free form or in the presence of inhibitors gluconolactone and cetyltrimethylammonium. Ligands were bound at the cleft of the active site near an enclosure formed by Trp232 and a flexible GASIG loop. A closed configuration at the active site cleft was observed in some molecules. The loop flexibility in the enzyme may contribute to the regulation of endo- or exo-activity of the enzyme and a preference to release laminaritrioses in long chain carbohydrate hydrolysis. Glu137 and Glu132 are proposed to serve as the proton donor and nucleophile, respectively, in the retaining catalysis of hydrolyzation. Calcium ions in the crystallization media are found to accelerate crystal growth. Comparison of laminarinase and endoglucanase structures revealed the subtle difference of key residues in the active site for the selection of $\beta$-1,3-glucan and $\beta$-1,4-glucan substrates, respectively. Arg85 may be pivotal to $\beta$-1,3 glucan substrate selection. The similarity of the structures between the laminarinase catalytic domain and its carbohydrate-binding (CBM) modules may have evolutionary relevance due to similarities in their folds.},

abstract = {To determine whether CsI can be dissociated by the action of an oxygen potential and, therefore, can cause low-ductility failure of Zircaloy cladding due to stress corrosion cracking (SCC), out-of-pile creep rupture and burst tests were performed. The oxygen potential in the tube specimens was established by various metal/metal oxide systems or O/U ratios of the UO2+x. The test parameters were selected in such a manner that burst temperatures of about 700°C were obtained. The results of the isothermal creep rupture tests with UO2+x of various O U ratios showed that at initial oxygen potentials as high as -230 kJ/mol O2 (which corresponds to an O U ratio of about 2.04 at 700°C), the CsI dissociates sufficiently to cause iodine-induced low-ductility cladding failure. When the oxygen potential was set by Mo/MoO2 mixtures, sufficient dissociation of CsI took place at much lower oxygen potentials of about -400 kJ/mol O2. With respect to the CsI dissociation both the formation of Cs oxides and the possible formation of complex compounds such as Cs uranate and Cs molybdate must be considered. Under these conditions, the I from the CsI behaved like elemental iodine. That is, iodine-induced low-ductility failure of the Zircaloy-4 tubing due to SCC occurred when the fission-product element iodine was present as either elemental I or as CsI. {\textcopyright}1985.},

There has only been a low incidence of PCI failures in PWR cladding, and the problem has not loomed large enough to require the adoption of either of the above protective methods in these reactors, although experimental liner cladding has been tested.

abstract = {One of the main sources of error associated with the calculation of defect formation energies using plane-wave Density Functional Theory (DFT) is finite size error resulting from the use of relatively small simulation cells and periodic boundary conditions. Most widely-used methods for correcting this error, such as that of Makov and Payne, assume that the dielectric response of the material is isotropic and can be described using a scalar dielectric constant $\epsilon$. However, this is strictly only valid for cubic crystals, and cannot work in highly-anisotropic cases. Here we introduce a variation of the technique of extrapolation based on the Madelung potential, that allows the calculation of well converged dilute limit defect formation energies in non-cubic systems with highly anisotropic dielectric properties. As an example of the implementation of this technique we study a selection of defects in the ceramic oxide Li$_2$TiO$_3$ which is currently being considered as a lithium battery material and a breeder material for fusion reactors.},

We considered the effects of vdW interactions on the physical properties of the adsorbed species using three different approaches: two variants of the pairwise force field method proposed by Grimme (DFT+D2 and DFT+D2?), and the vdW-DF method in which the vdW contribution is expressed directly as a function of the electron density. The results show that, already at the level of metal atoms and small clusters, the inclusion of vdW interactions can change the order of stability of various isomers and, more importantly, can result in major corrections to the adsorption energies. These effects can, in turn, affect other properties such as the structure and chemical reactivity of supported metal particles on oxides or their diffusion properties.},

Behavior of cracked pellets, subjected to cladding restriction, was evaluated by analogy to compaction of granular materials. From this work a gap model was proposed to express gap closure during rise to power. The concept of a critical void ratio was introduced for determination of the hard PCI (pellet-cladding interaction) onset condition. The following results were obtained within the range of the design parameters and operating conditions of typical BWR fuel rods. 1. (1) When the rod power, P, reached P = 60 W/cm, pellets simultaneously cracked and increased their diameters (pellet jump). The amount of pellet jump, $\Delta$Dj, could be given by $\Delta$Dj ($\mu$m) = 3.6 D, where D is pellet diameter (mm). 2. (2) The gap G(B)($\mu$m) could be given from the following relocation, assuming that K is the gap change ($\mu$m) caused by phenomena which do not directly participate in pellet cracking (e.q. swelling, creep); G(B)=C′1(2-C3)e-C2A-C′1(1-C3) e-(C2A+C4B) where A = (P-60), B is the burnup (GWD/T), C1 = G0 - ($\Delta$Dj + K), G0 is the initial gap ($\mu$m), C2 = 0.0039, C3 = 1.41 and C4 = 0.95. 3.

abstract = {The evaluation of reaction energies between solids using density functional theory (DFT) is of practical importance in many technological fields and paramount in the study of the phase stability of known and predicted compounds. In this work, we present a comparison between reaction energies provided by experiments and computed by DFT in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), using a Hubbard U parameter for some transitionmetal elements (GGA+U).We use a data set of 135 reactions involving the formation of ternary oxides from binary oxides in a broad range of chemistries and crystal structures. We find that the computational errors can be modeled by a normal distribution with a mean close to zero and a standard deviation of 24 meV/atom. The significantly smaller error compared to the more commonly reported errors in the formation energies from the elements is related to the larger cancellation of errors in energies when reactions involve chemically similar compounds. This result is of importance for phase diagram computations for which the relevant reaction energies are often not from the elements but from chemically close phases (e.g., ternary oxides versus binary oxides). In addition, we discuss the distribution of computational errors among chemistries and show that the use of a Hubbard U parameter is critical to the accuracy of reaction energies involving transition metals even when no major change in formal oxidation state is occurring.},

Several aspects, which are of importance for polar surfaces, are discussed on the basis of the results from the asym. setup. Among other things the dielec. const. can be derived from the slab calcns. For the more stable (101) surface a surface phase diagram under H and O atm. is presented. Finally, the interaction between Y dopants and the surface is analyzed. While such defects prefer positions far from the surface for a (001) oriented surface, the more stable (101) surface becomes even more stabilized by defects close to the surface.

@article{Chevalier2009,
abstract = {Zirconia ceramics have found broad applications in a variety of energy and biomedical applications because of their unusual combination of strength, fracture toughness, ionic conductivity, and low thermal conductivity. These attractive characteristics are largely associated with the stabilization of the tetragonal and cubic phases through alloying with aliovalent ions. The large concentration of vacancies introduced to charge compensate of the aliovalent alloying is responsible for both the exceptionally high ionic conductivity and the unusually low, and temperature independent, thermal conductivity. The high fracture toughness exhibited by many of zirconia ceramics is attributed to the constraint of the tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation and its release during crack propagation. In other zirconia ceramics containing the tetragonal phase, the high fracture toughness is associated with ferroelastic domain switching. However, many of these attractive features of zirconia, especially fracture toughness and strength, are compromised after prolonged exposure to water vapor at intermediate temperatures (∼30°–300°C) in a process referred to as low-temperature degradation (LTD), and initially identified over two decades ago. This is particularly so for zirconia in biomedical applications, such as hip implants and dental restorations. Less well substantiated is the possibility that the same process can also occur in zirconia used in other applications, for instance, zirconia thermal barrier coatings after long exposure at high temperature. Based on experience with the failure of zirconia femoral heads, as well as studies of LTD, it is shown that many of the problems of LTD can be mitigated by the appropriate choice of alloying and/or process control.},

From this it can be concluded that random-phase-approximation-like calculations, like the present one or that of Rasolt and Geldart, which treat this region correctly, are likely to provide accurate results for the gradient coefficient and hence for the energy and structure of a system whose density is truly slowly varying. However, it also shows that the criterion for the validity of the gradient approximation itself is much more severe than previously supposed, so that the usual type of application, to say a surface or bulk material, is incorrect. For the surface case this is verified in unequivocal detail. On the other hand, a generalization of the gradient scheme based on an average slope instead of a local slope is proposed. This gives good agreement with limiting cases where they exist, and rough agreement with the interpolation scheme proposed previously by the authors.},

Neutron diffraction patterns were also collected during the in situ oxidation of powder samples at 483 K. The lattice parameters and relative ratios of the four pure phases were measured during the progression of the isothermal oxidation. The transformation of UO(2) into U(3)O(8) involves a complex modification of the oxygen sublattice and the onset of complex superstructures for U(4)O(9) and U(3)O(7), associated with regular stacks of complex defects known as cuboctahedra, which consist of 13 oxygen atoms.

The W-type voids were observed in the intergranular fracture. As the crack proceeded, transgranular fracture, or cleavage facet, became predominant. Cleavage facets were separated by tearing ridges as well as by fluting marks. The appearance of tearing ridges is consistent with the increase of slip systems in $\alpha$-zirconium with increasing temperature. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

Under neutron irradiation W undergoes transmutation to its near-neighbours in the periodic table. Additionally He and H are particles emitted from certain neutron-induced reactions, and this is particularly significant in fusion research since the presence of helium in a material can cause both swelling and a strong increase in brittleness. This paper presents the results of inventory burn-up calculations on pure W and gives quantitative estimates for He production rates in both a fusion-reactor environment and under conditions expected in the ITER experimental device. Transmutation reactions in possible alloying elements (Re, Ta, Ti and V), which could be used to reduce the brittleness of pure W, are also considered. Additionally, for comparison, the transmutation of other fusion-relevant materials, including Fe and SiC, are presented. {\textcopyright} 2011 IAEA, Vienna.},

In particular, the models of thermal conductance of the gap and of pellet-cladding mechanical interaction incorporated to the code constitute two realistic tools. The possibility of gap closure (including partial contact between rough surfaces) and reopening during burnup is allowed.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society. Zirconium-niobium alloys are currently proposed for applications in water-cooled nuclear reactors. However, the mechanisms by which Nb impacts the corrosion resistance of these alloys are yet to be clarified. In this work, we utilize a thermodynamic framework informed by density functional theory calculations to predict the effect of Nb on the equilibria of charged defects in tetragonal ZrO 2 , and discuss how the changes in the defect concentrations affect the protectiveness of this oxide that grows natively on Zr alloys during oxidation. Our analysis shows that Nb dissolves predominantly in the oxidation state 5+ as a substitutional defect on the Zr sublattice, with charge compensation achieved by the negatively charged Zr vacancies. Moreover, Nb dissolution is limited to the oxygen-rich conditions, i.e., in the oxide surface facing oxidizing environment. We validate this finding by performing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on oxidized Zr-Nb alloys. The introduction of Nb in tetragonal ZrO 2 is found to enhance the concentration of Zr vacancies and of free electrons and to decrease the concentration of oxygen vacancies. We conclude that the net effect of Nb on the corrosion kinetics of Zr alloys is favorable if the rate limiting process is oxygen transport, while Nb would be detrimental if electron transport limits the oxidation kinetics.},
