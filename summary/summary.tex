\subsection{Fission product empirical potential}

In order to study the interaction of fission products with larger features in the cladding microstructure, such as dislocations and grain boundaries, it is necessary to develop empirical potentials for use in molecular dynamics simulations. Grain boundary transport is of particular interest, and this would require something on the order of 10$^{4}$ atoms to simulate to a reasonable degree of accuracy. This cannot be done using DFT currently due to the significant amount of computing resources required to run such a simulation. 

The development of an iodine and xenon potential with \zirconia\ should be prioritised in order to run simulations to determine the migration of iodine within \zirconia, followed by the behaviour of xenon at the equilibrium iodine sites.

\subsection{Zr/ZrO/\zirconia\ interface study}

The inner oxide is not a homogeneous structure, as described in ยง \ref{ch:crystallography}. Figure \ref{fig:zro_interface} clearly shows the existence of a ZrO phase up to 200 nm thick at the interface between \zirconia\ and Zr metal. The presence of ZrO and even oxygen-saturated Zr metal will have an effect on the thermodynamic equilibria of different fission products. An interface study can be conducted using DFT, to determine stresses at the interfaces of Zr and ZrO, and ZrO and \zirconia . Studying the aggregate effect of these interfaces on fission product behaviour may require larger molecular dynamics simulations, however. The crystal structure of the ZrO phase has been studied using both simulation and high-resolution electron microscopy, with two likely crystal structures being proposed \cite{Nicholls2015}. Further atomistic studies must be conducted to determine the stability of each crystal structure of ZrO when constrained by \zirconia\ and oxygen-saturated Zr metal interfaces.

\subsection{Experimental work}

\subsubsection{Tetragonal phase stabilisation}

A key finding in this thesis is that tetragonal phase \zirconia\ (as opposed to monoclinic) provides the barrier effect against corrosive fission products. It would therefore be useful to conduct experiments on claddings designed to maximise the content of tetragonal phase \zirconia\ in the internal oxide layer. While this can be achieved with a tetragonal stabilising dopant (e.g. scandium, yttrium), this will increase the concentration of oxygen vacancies which may lead to reduced corrosion performance. 

Another method is to increase the amount of tetragonal phase in the oxide layer is to reduce the Zr grain size. This is an attractive option because the chemical composition of the cladding will be unchanged, and the increased strength does not come at the cost of ductility. 

\subsubsection{Oxygen environment control}

In-pile irradiation tests (e.g. power ramps, high burn-up behaviour) to examine the effect of increasing the oxygen content in fuel pins would provide useful data on PCI performance. Presently, fuel pins are filled with helium because it is an inert gas, it does not affect the neutronics within the core and has a high thermal conductivity compared to other gases. One option for varying oxygen content in a fuel pin is to use a fill gas which is a mixture of helium and oxygen. 

Although oxygen (most of which is \ch{O^{16}_{8}}) is not inert and has a lower thermal conductivity than helium, it is highly resistant to neutron activation due to a combination of very low thermal neutron absorption cross-section and three stable isotopes (i.e. three consecutive neutron captures are required to produce an unstable \ch{O^{19}_{8}} nucleus). Adding oxygen to the fill gas is also a much simpler (and therefore cheaper) method of increasing oxygen content compared to changing the stoichiometry of the fuel.
